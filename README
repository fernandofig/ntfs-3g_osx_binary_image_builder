This shell script will automate through the steps necessary to build a fully working NTFS-3G Install image for OSX, compiled against Fuse4X (fuse4x.github.io) or OSXFuse (osxfuse.github.io). You'll need to install either of those (but not both) in order to use this script:
 
 - Fuse4X is deprecated and no longer maintained, although as of OSX 10.11, it still works.
 - OSXFuse is in active development, but only version 3.2.0 (which at the time of this writing is a developer preview) onwards will work correctly with NTFS-3G.

 Although the binary image, once built, works by itself without any other dependencies besides Fuse4X or OSXFuse, a working install of MacPorts (along with MacPorts own requirements, like e.g. XCode) is required to build it.

This binary image was tested and found to be working on OSX El Capitan. Feedback is welcome for earlier versions of OSX.

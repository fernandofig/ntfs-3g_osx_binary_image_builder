This shell script will automate through the steps necessary to build a fully working NTFS-3G Install image for OSX, compiled against Fuse4X (www.fuse4x.org - you should install it before compiling the binary image). Although the binary image, once built, works by itself without any other dependencies besides Fuse4X, a working install of MacPorts (along with MacPorts own requirements, like e.g. XCode) is required to build it.

This binary image was tested and found to be working on OSX Lion. Feedback is welcome for earlier versions of OSX.
